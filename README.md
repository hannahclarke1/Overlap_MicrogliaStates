Quarto R Script used to overlap Diffenetially expressed genes from RNA sequencing to known microglial states using GeneOverlap package. 

Specifically:
- Disease Associated Microglia: DAM (Keren-Shaul et al. 2017)
- Human Alzheimer's Microglia: HAM (Srinivasan et al. 2020)
- DAM and Disease inflammatory macrophages (DIM) from HuMiCA (Martins-Ferreira et al. 2025) 

This script was used to generate FigS2 data in Evans, Grant-Peters, Beckwith et al. 2025.
